**Description**

As new graduates entering the Canadian job market during the pandemic, we three are curious about:

- How has the labor market in Canada changed over the past five years in terms of its characteristics/ patterns/ trends? How can we better visualize and present these changes by employing possible models?
- If we look at and analyze those patterns over these years- what could be the possible forces driving the changes? Government policy, technology and economy? (more research required for solid conclusions)

Our analysis may be based on two index keys, i.e. **NAICS code** and **Year**. Once we obtain the some general insights about the characteristics/ patterns/ trends of the employee distribution, we can move to more specific topics which interest us most such as:

- Specific Field- IT, Healthcare or whatever interests us during our exploration. However, we might need specific datasets to supplement our analysis as per our needs. IT industry, for instance:
- Specific Region and Regional Differences- Mega cities like Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto vs. rural areas
