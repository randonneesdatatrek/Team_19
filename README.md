Description

As new graduates going to entry job market during the pandemic, we are curious about:

How have the labor markets changed over the past five years, characteristics/ patterns/ trends? How can we visualize them by trying different models?
If we look at those patterns discovered over time- what would be the possible forces driving those moves such as government policy, technology and economy? (Might need external research to supplement)
Our analysis may be based on two index keys, i.e. NAICS code and Year. Once we get some general insights about the characteristics/ patterns/ trends of the employee distribution, we can move to more specific topics which interest us most such as:

Specific Field- IT, Healthcare or whatever interests us during our exploration. However, we might need specific datasets to supplement our analysis as per our needs. IT industry, for instance:
Specific Region- Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto etc.
